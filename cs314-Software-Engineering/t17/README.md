### Team Work Preferences
We are team t17, The Moist Pigeons, a small group of hard working Computer Science students. We've come together from a multitude of disciplines and diverse backgrounds with a strong desire to learn, build, and collaborate together throughout the semester. As a group we discussed and combined our personal work habits, preferences, and styles into a cohesive platform. Within this framework, we believe that we are well suited as a team to succeed, handling known and unknown issues that arise in our projects.

**Meetings**

In order to accommodate our online team members, we have decided to have our daily sprint meetings after class at 4pm Monday, Wednesday, and Friday on Zoom. Additionally, we plan to have a one hour weekly meeting on Saturdays at 11am, to ensure our online teammates are up to date with the rest of the team and to discuss issues/ideas in depth. This weekly meeting will be held on Zoom as well. Finally, as we begin to work on the project, additional meetings may be scheduled. These meetings will be held on Zoom or on campus depending on team member's availability/needs.

**Hours worked/week**

Each team member should prepare to spend around 6-8 hours per week on team-related assigments and projects. The amount of hours per week necessary may be subject to change depending on the amount of work required for a specific Sprint. We expect this work to be completed in small segments throughout the week rather than all at once. If a member is unable to make a conribution to the team's assignments and projects for the day, they should dedicate extra time in the following days so as to avoid preventing the progress of other team members. Should any major events or emergencies arise that might prevent work from being completed, the team member should alert other members immediately so that we can formulate a plan to redistribute the workload. 

**Settling Disputes**

Whenever conflict arises with regards to members failing to fulfill expectations, we’ll discuss what went wrong and how to prevent it from happening again. If such issues persist, we’ll consult with the instructor. In the event of a disagreement with regards to how we approach tasks we will acknowledge alternative viewpoints and consider which course of action has more holistic merit. We’ll try to reach a compromise if we can’t reach a definitive right answer. If no consensus is reached or the subject matter is unable to be compromised, we’ll proceed with the majority opinion.

**Wrapping it up**

As a team, we have discussed all of these issues above openly and have agreed on all of them. We are excited to work together as a team for this semester, and have done the necessary behind-the-scenes work/discussion to make sure our team works as efficiently as possible. From discussing meeting times, to conflict resolution, our team has discussed all hiccups we could encounter on our semester long project. We look forward to working on this project for you.
