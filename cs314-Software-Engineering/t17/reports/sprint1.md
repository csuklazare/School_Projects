## Planned Epics

For this first sprint we have two planned epics, Team Identification and About. These epics will give information to the user about the team that has built the application. These epics will help the customer decide if they want to use our product.

The team identification epic will provide the user with information about the team as a unitary entity. This will enable the organization to more effectively identify the team to the organization. As part of this epic we will create a team name to use to identify ourselves to the rest of the organization. We'll update the team identification number in the browser tab and the application header/footer. This will enable quickly find the team's name for identification and organizational purposes.
  
The about epic will inform the customer about the team. This is important because customers like to know who built the application. If they know about the team then they have a greater ability to judge if the application fits their needs, along with having greater confidence when picking the application. This epic will first include our team's mission statement and a photo of the team. We will also add bios on all the team members. Each will give a short description of individual team members, a photo, and a name. The design of this epic will utilize progressive disclosure, a design strategy that offers information in a pattern or sequence. This will reduce clutter, improve readability, and reduces the chance that the user will feel overwhelmed.

## Retrospective

#### Things that went well
The team worked well together, continuing to support one another as we work through confusion as a whole. Team members were not shy to ask 
questions in the slack channel and help was always readily available. Tasks were tackled early and mostly with little issue. Team members became familiar
with ZenHub pipeline workflow, terminal branch push/pull process, and general scrum process. Scrum meeting schedule was nailed down and is working well, 
as is our weekly planning meetings. 

#### Things that we need to improve
There was some back and forth on some PRs. Some had to be closed and remade and there were some direct commits to main. As we learn and familiarize ourselves 
with these tools, these faults will become less common, but we should strive to eliminate them. 

#### One thing we will change next time
Team members will alert the team when a new version is released and get a cross check to ensure server functionality.
