# Preferences for Travis Schroeder

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Slack -> text 10am - 9pm, MWF, I am very busy T,TH
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I expect our team to accomplish a well working finished product by the end of semester, additionaly I expect to learn alot about working together in a team. 
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * My personal goals are to be prompt in replying to my teammates and reaching out to teammates when I need help or offering my help to a struggling teammate. 
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Balancing the workload of this class with the rest of school and life. Time management, additionally communication issues. 
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * My personal feeling is to shoot for the A and being able to say we put in an honest effort, but I also understand if it ends up being challenging and we get a B. 
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * I think this depends on how much extra work is being put in by the teammate and in what context. I think doing a little extra is ok but if they are doing         the extra work to compensate for a slacking teammate then the slacking teammate should be addressed.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * Not exactly sure but if I had to guess maybe about 8-10 hours a week?
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * Not sure exactly, I think this should be discussed with the team. Possibly estimating the perceived difficulty then assigning them equally. I also don't  mind if people pick their preferred tasks. 
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * In my opinion this depends on context, if they are consistently not following through this needs to be addressed by the team and the professor should be 
 reached out too. 
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * This is tough, if the work is objectively bad then it should be constructively criticised. I think people should be respectful and realistic when
expressing their opinion about someone's work. 
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * I feel like I am adaptable and can handle the work habits of other team members. I can change my work schedule around theirs if needed too. As long as 
things are getting done in a timely manner. 
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I like having it in class as it is convenient for me. I am flexible and am willing to change if the online students really want to change it. 
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * Perhaps once or twice per week depending on project workload.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * I don't think so, some decisions are pretty minor, generally if a couple teammates weigh in it should be ok.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Acknowledge their dissent, talk to them about it and understand why. At the end of the day though I think it should be ok to overrule them if there is an overwhelming majority. 
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Depends on if the person is a good leader I guess ha ha. If they are being too heavy handed though I think they should be addressed by the team.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I would bring it up with the team, let them know that I feel like they need to step it up and that I'm under water.
