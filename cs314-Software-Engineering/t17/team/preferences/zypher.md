# Preferences for zypher (Tony Gatts)

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * In order of liklihood to see: Text > Slack > Email. Feel free to reach out and DM me on slack for my phone number. Any time after 9AM and before 9PM is preferred. 
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I would like get an A in the class and on the projects, but coming short of that, I would simply like to learn more about all the things we're going to learn in the class.
     I am genuinely excited to learn how to manage coding projects at this scale. 
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I sometimes have a tendency to work on my own. I would like to callaborate better and stay in touch with my team members on a regular basis. I also have a tendancy
     to be kinda unreachable (but I'm working on it!)
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Everybody has their own lives and stuff going on. Many work or have families. I don't know much about my team yet, but those certainly could be reasonable obstacles.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * Hard question. I will always try and do my best, shooting for an A and doing whatever I can to get there. 
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * I think so. I would want everyone to contribute the same and try for an A, but some people may just not have time or be willing to put in that effort. 
     The project grading system should hopefully take care of that where those who go the extra mile are rewarded.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I honestly have no idea. 8 hours? 10 hours? That's about what I budget per class per week. 
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * I think a mix of people who feel they are good at certain things and people who may not be good, but want to learn a particular process. 
     Good communication early to set project tasks, goals, and expectations will be key. 
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * It would entirely depend on the reason. 
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   *  I think having an open discussion about the work in question would be helpful. Each person makes their case and hopefully a consensus can be reached. 
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * I always try to be as accomondating as possible. If someone works harder than me, I want to work just as hard so I can be as helpful as possible. 
     If someone is putting in less hours, I don't think I would hold that against them unless the work effort was agregiously low. 
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Yes. Clear and consistent communication I think is key. 
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * Once a week officially sounds good to me.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * I don't really know how the roles and project will be divvied up. I don't mind one way or the other that much as long as an
     expectation is set and followed. 
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Democracy
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Make sure everyone feels like their voices are heard. 
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Do them, but also ask for help.
