1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * It is easiest to reach me by text or through Slack, I work mornings but am off most afternoons. Sometimes I have other things come up in the afternoons where I can't get on my computer right away. But a text I can answer all hours I am not sleeping.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I think my team will accomplish a lot this semester. Whether from learning teamwork skills, to learning GitHub, or succeeding at assignments assigned to us, I have full confidence my team can accomplish all of these goals.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * My personal goals are to make sure I am available as much as possible as I am an online student. I don't want to inhibit my fellow teammates abilities to do their work if I am unavailable.
   My communication skills can always improve, and one thing I need to improve on is making sure I listen fully to others before I give my response.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Any number of obstacles could arise, from personal issues, to computer issues, but the main one is if my team doesn't work well together, and won't try to improve how we work together. This is the biggest obstacle my team could face.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * As a team, we would need to discuss what our expectations are for each assignment and the quality of work we are putting forward.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * I think it is acceptable, to a degree. I think no matter how you divide up the work, someone (or multiple people) are going to be doing more of the work than others. The fair thing is to rotate it for the next assignment so that not the same students are doing the hardest parts every time.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I personally haven't looked too much into the group project yet, but judging by the stories I have heard and from just this first week of class assignments, I would say a lot. Probably around 15 hours a week dedicated solely to the project.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * As a team, we should analyze our strengths/weaknesses for the project and try to divide the work up according to that. The caveat here is to make sure that not the same students are doing the hardest parts every week. This isn't fair, and it also puts the rest of the students at a disadvantage moving forward because they don't know how to do that task.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * If they have some unforeseen incident come up, that is ok. But if it happens multiple times (2/3), then as a team, we should contact Dave.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * All opinions should be heard, and as a team, we should decide what work we would like to put forward.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * As long as the work is getting done in a timely manner, it is of good quality, and it is not restricting anyone else in the team's work, then I don't see a reason to deal with their work habits.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * As we delve more into the project, I think it would be a great idea.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * I do not know. With Slack and instant messaging software, it is very easy for people to stay connected to one another throughout the day, potentially minimizing the need for the entire team to meet.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * It depends on the decision. If it is something in my work, no, I am going to make my best decision. If it is a more group decision that affects all of us, it should be brought forward before the group.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * As a team, we should ask that specific group member what they feel like is wrong with the decision and try to convince them otherwise. If they still do not agree, then I think we should side with the majority of the team.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * A leader of the team is fine, but if they become dominating, I would confer with other team members to see if they feel the same way. If they do, I would talk to that team member and just let them know how the rest of the team is feeling.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I will try to divy them up as best I can. If they are falling on me for a specific reason, I should be able to manage and work through it. But I don't want any hitchhikers to take advantage of me.
