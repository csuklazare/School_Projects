# Preferences for _Alex Waddle_

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * I will be making it a habit to check slack regularly throughout the day. If you are not able to get into contact with me feel free to text me (my phone number is in the t17 slack channel). 
   * I am typically available from about 9am-9pm but may be working on other homework assignments or attending lectures.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I am hoping we learn to work well as a team and accomplish tasks efficiently. 
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * My goal is to make sure I can manage my time appropriately so that I am contributing fairly to the team's tasks. 
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * I am one of the students that will be participating remotely, it will be slightly more difficult to keep up with the team while missing out on the in-person meetings.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I think each member should be putting in full effort when they are working on the team assignments for this course. 
   * We should not settle for a lower grade to save time or effort, but as long as everyone is putting in full effort the letter grade is less important. 
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * The work for each assignment should be divided up as evenly as possible. 
   * If one or more members decide to complete extra work that is not a problem but may not be an expectation of every member.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * It is hard to judge without seeing the assignments, but I expect the projects will require about an hour to an hour and a half each day.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * I think we should try to assign people to where they are the strongest in ability, though the work should still be divided as evenly as possible. 
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * If there is an emergency or major life event that gets in the way the rest of the team can attempt to cover the missing work. If it is happening frequently or due to laziness we should get into contact with a TA.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * Each member should be able to share their opinions, and we should do our best to reach a common conclusion or compromise. 
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * As we get more practice working as a team, I think we will be able to find a good balance between varying work habits of each member. 
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I think we should deal with this week-to-week, as it can be hard to find a time where each member can be available indefinitely. 
   * As the taskload increases during sprints, this may become important and we can find a good time for everyone each week or however often we feel the need to meet. 
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * I think we should meet about 1-2 times per week especially during sprints. Outside of that, we should maintain contact over slack most days. 
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * If the outcome of the decision will affect other teammates, I think it is a good idea to seek approval. If it is a small personal decision about a task if may not be necessary.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Every opinion should be considered, but we will need to reach a conclusion at some point. If we cannot reach an agreement it should be up to the majority. 
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * There are some points where one team member may take the lead on a certain task or assignment but this should not be the case for the entire semester.
   * I think we can discuss this as a team if we all feel that one member is dominating too much of the tema process. 
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I will try to delegate some of the work to other teammates. If they are still leaving their own work for me to complete I will talk to other team members and possibly a TA.
