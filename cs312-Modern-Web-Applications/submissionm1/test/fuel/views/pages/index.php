<h1>Boolean Hooligans</h1>
    <div id="welcome">
        <p>Boolean Hooligans is a web development company built by four college students at Colorado State University. Check out our <b>About</b> page to learn more about the team!</p>
        <p>Our company's main goal is to create a web page that successfully creates a color coordinate generator. Check out our progress under <b>Color Coordinate</b>.</p>
        <p>The first phase of development will include getting the basic tables setup. This includes creating a basic table for selecting colors as well as the table that will be used as a grid for colors. The team will also begin work on a button that allows for a print view of the color coordinate generation page.</p>
        <p>The second phase of development will include finishing touches on the color coordinate generator. Users will be able to create images that can then be translated into a printable color sheet. </p>
