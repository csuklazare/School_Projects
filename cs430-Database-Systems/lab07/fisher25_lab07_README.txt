Brock Fisher's README file:

The only activity I couldn't do is:

"Add a new book to the Main library, ISBN # 96-42013-10513, shelf 8, floor 2, Title Growing your own Weeds, published by pubid 90000 on 6/24/2012. The reason for this, is there is no publisher name associated with this ID, so I cannot add in the new publisher to the Publisher table.
