This repository contains a collection of all of my school projects that I created myself or helped work on.


Please note: not all of the code provided in the following files is my own. Much of it was given to me by professors, and I was tasked to either finish it or refactor it.
I will try to include Read-Me files for all programs with instructions on how to run them, as well as the overarching goal of the assignment.
